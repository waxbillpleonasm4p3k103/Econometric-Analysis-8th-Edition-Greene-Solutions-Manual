  * For first-¿year graduate courses in Econometrics for Social Scientists.
  * Bridging the gap between social science studies and econometric analysis
 
  * Designed to bridge the gap between social science studies and field-econometrics,Econometric Analysis, 8th Edition presents this ever-growing area at an accessible level. The book first introduces readers to basic techniques, a rich variety of models, and underlying theory that is easy to put into practice. It then presents readers with a sufficient theoretical background to understand advanced techniques and to recognize new variants of established models. This focus, along with hundreds of worked numerical examples, ensures that readers can apply the theory to real-world application and are prepared to be successful economists in the field.
